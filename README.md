Simple Rule-Based Chatbot
This project demonstrates a basic chatbot built in Python using only if-else conditional statements. The chatbot simulates conversation by matching user inputs against predefined patterns, applying fundamental NLP principles without advanced libraries.

## Tools Used
Python 3.x

## Methodology
Rule-based response system utilizing if-else conditionals.

Input normalization (lowercase, trimming) for robust pattern matching.

Sequential conditional checks for intent recognition.

Default fallback response for unrecognized inputs.

## Learning Outcomes
Learned preprocessing and normalization of user input.

Understood pattern-based intent classification using conditionals.

Practiced handling unrecognized queries with fallback logic.

Developed simple dialogue flow control using loops and statements.

Explored foundational NLP structure for chatbot development.
